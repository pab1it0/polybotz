# Polling interval in seconds (minimum: 10, default: 60)
poll_interval: 60

# Percentage change threshold to trigger alert (default: 5.0)
# A spike is detected when price changes by this percentage between polls
spike_threshold: 5.0

# LVR (Liquidity-to-Volume Ratio) threshold for liquidity warnings (default: 8.0)
# A Liquidity Warning is triggered when price spikes AND LVR exceeds this threshold
# Lower values = more sensitive, Higher values = only flag severe imbalances
lvr_threshold: 8.0

# Z-score threshold for volume spike alerts via CLOB API (default: 3.5)
zscore_threshold: 3.5

# MAD multiplier for price anomaly alerts via CLOB API (default: 3.0)
mad_multiplier: 3.0

# Alert cooldown settings - reduce alert fatigue for sustained anomalies
# Cooldown period in minutes before re-alerting for the same anomaly (default: 30)
# Set to 0 to disable cooldown (alerts fire every poll cycle)
cooldown_minutes: 30

# Z-score/MAD escalation threshold to re-alert during cooldown (default: 1.0)
# If the z-score increases by this amount, alert immediately despite cooldown
escalation_threshold: 1.0

# Detectors to enable (default: all enabled)
# Available detectors: spike, lvr, zscore, mad, closed
# Options:
#   - List specific detectors: [spike, lvr]
#   - Enable all: "all"
#   - Disable all (monitoring only): "none"
#   - Omit field entirely to enable all (backward compatible)
detectors:
  - spike   # Price spike detection
  - lvr     # Liquidity-to-Volume Ratio analysis
  - zscore  # Z-score volume anomaly detection (CLOB API)
  - mad     # Median Absolute Deviation price anomaly (CLOB API)
  - closed  # Closed market detection
